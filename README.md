*What is your motivation?
- My motivation is for the riders that want to serve or help people in the event of pandemic, because most riders want to ride everytime they want but this event there is a problem that they cant ride anywhere so if they want to ride they need to serve and help in the pandemic and they need to be one of frontliners for that they are valid to ride but this is not just the riders for the people who donâ€™t want to go outside of their houses and you can depend on the rider to send the item and receive to its receiver, they no longer have to worry because the rider are healthy and well maintenance.
